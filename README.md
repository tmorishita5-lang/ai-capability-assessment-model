AI Capability Assessment Model

Proposed by Morishita (2025)
A conceptual framework explaining why AI results differ significantly across users—even when using the same model.

🔍 Overview

This repository introduces the AI Capability Assessment Model, a structured approach to understanding why AI performance varies dramatically from person to person.

Modern AI systems are powerful, but their output quality depends heavily on human capability:

Why do two people using the same AI get completely different results?

Why does AI accelerate high performers but overwhelm others?

What determines whether AI output becomes insight or noise?

This model provides a clear, systematic answer.

🎯 Core Insight

Even the most advanced AI produces limited results without effective human utilization.

Human capability is the key that unlocks all AI-driven value.

AI performance is co-created by:

The model’s abilities, and

The user’s ability to leverage those abilities.

🧩 Model Structure

The AI Capability Assessment Model organizes capability into four layers, each shaping the quality of AI-driven outcomes:

1. Perception Capability

Ability to recognize problems, ask meaningful questions, and detect critical signals.

2. Interpretation Capability

Ability to translate complex real-world issues into structured prompts, abstractions, and context models.

3. Operational Capability

Skill in applying AI tools effectively—prompting, refining, decomposing tasks, and managing iterations.

4. Integration Capability

Ability to connect AI outputs with domain knowledge, strategy, decision-making, and execution.

🚀 Why This Matters

Depending on these four capabilities, AI becomes either:

✅ A productivity multiplier

— enabling deeper insight, faster thinking, and higher-quality decisions

or

❌ A superficial tool

— producing shallow, misaligned, or misleading outputs.

This model explains why skill gaps widen with AI adoption rather than shrink.

🧠 Background / Origin

As AI adoption grows, organizations consistently observe:

“Why do output quality and business impact differ so much, even when everyone uses the same AI?”

This model is built on analysis of:

Cognitive processing differences

Question formulation skill

Abstraction and decomposition ability

Human–AI feedback loop design

Context integration in decision-making

AI is no longer the differentiator.
Human capability is.
