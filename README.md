# AI Capability Assessment Model  
**Proposed by Morishita (2025)**  
A conceptual framework to evaluate why AI results differ significantly from person to person —  
even when using the same model.

## 🔍 Overview  
This repository introduces the **AI Capability Assessment Model**, a structured approach to understanding variations in AI performance among users.  
Although advanced AI systems continue to evolve, **their effectiveness depends heavily on the capability of the person using them**.

This presentation explores a key question:

> **Why do AI results differ from person to person  
> even when the same AI is used?**

The model demonstrates that:

- Even the best AI yields limited outcomes without effective utilization.
- Human capability acts as the “unlock key” for extracting value from AI.
- User capability determines whether AI output becomes *insight* or *noise*.

## 🧩 Model Description  
The AI Capability Assessment Model proposes that AI performance is not solely determined by the model itself.  
Instead, performance is **co-created** by both the AI system and the individual leveraging it.

The model organizes capability into the following layers:

1. **Perception Capability**  
   Ability to recognize problems, ask questions, and detect what matters.

2. **Interpretation Capability**  
   Ability to translate real-world issues into structured prompts and abstractions.

3. **Operational Capability**  
   Skill in applying AI tools efficiently and iteratively.

4. **Integration Capability**  
   Ability to connect AI outputs with context, strategy, and real-world decision-making.

These layers determine whether AI becomes:

- a productivity multiplier, or  
- a superficial tool producing shallow or incorrect outputs.

## 🚀 Usage  
This repository currently includes:

- **Presentation slides (PPTX)** explaining the model  
- Conceptual definitions and diagrams  
- Exportable materials for internal discussions, lectures, or organizational adoption

Future updates may include:

- Interactive diagrams  
- Worksheets for capability self-assessment  
- Prompt templates aligned with each capability layer

## 🧠 Background  
As AI adoption accelerates, a recurring issue emerges:

> “同じAIを使っているのに、成果がなぜこんなに違うのか？”

This model provides a structured explanation grounded in:

- Cognitive processing differences  
- Question formulation skill  
- Abstraction capability  
- Real-world decision integration  
- Feedback loop design

In short:

**AI is no longer the differentiator.  
Human capability is.**
